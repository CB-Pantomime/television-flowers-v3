# television-flowers-v3

After five years of photographing flowers on my television, from movies and shows, I narrowed down my favorite 64 from several hundred. 
This application retrieves those 64 resources at the backend server from the image host Cloudinary, does a fisher yates shuffle, and then delivers 14 images to the frontend client. The first and last image are fixed to be always the same, somewhat like front and back covers to a book. Decided to go the short and sweet route and give each view only 16 total images, rather than all 64 at once. 

The first and second books I made from this series are long sold out, so this application will work as a placeholder while the third 
and final book waits to get sequenced, designed, and printed. 

Thanks for checking in!
