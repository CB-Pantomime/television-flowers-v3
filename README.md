# television-flowers-v3

After five years of photographing flowers on my television, from movies and shows, I narrowed down my favorite 64 from several hundred. 
This application retrieves those 64 resources at the backend server from the image host Cloudinary, does a fisher yates shuffle, and delivers 14 random 
choices to the frontend client. The first and last image are fixed to be always the same, somewhat like front and back covers to a book. 

The first and second books I made from this series are long sold out, so this application will work as a placeholder while the third 
and final book waits to get sequenced, designed, and printed. 

Thanks for checking in!
